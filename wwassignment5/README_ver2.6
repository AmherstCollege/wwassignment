This version of the assignment level bridge between
moodle and webwork works for Moodle 2.6+ and 
WeBWorK 2.7+

The update that allows these modules to work with Moodle 2.0
were done by Jonathan Duncan, Professor of Mathematics at Walla Walla University.
http://math.wallawalla.edu/~duncjo/


To install
(1) move the wwlink directory, currently in the blocks subdirectory,
 into the moodle/blocks directory 
(2) move the wwassignment directory, currently in the mod subdirectory,
 into the moodle/mod directory.
 
A moodle administrator will need to login from the web in order to activate the new 
module and set up the preferences so that it points to a local webwork server.




Instructor tips for using wwassignment4 with moodle 1.9+ or wwassignment5 with moodle 2.* are here:

The moodle  configuration directions for wwassignment4 and for wwassignment5 are here:
http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Moodle_Assignment#Configuration

The webwork configurations for wwassignment4 and for wwassignmen5 are also here:

Nothing new needs to be added to WeBWorK to allow it work in conjunction with moodle
but a few features have to be turned on, and on URL may have to be updated in WSDL.pm.

Finally there is much expertise and support for using moodle and webwork together on the 
forum.
