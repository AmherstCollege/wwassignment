<p align='center'><b>Grading Methods</b></p>

<p>The grading method you choose will determine how your students' grades
are calculated.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Simple:</b> For each problem in the set, if the student gets it
		correct in any of his attempts, 1 point is awarded. If he fails to
		ever do so, 0 points are awarded. The maximum grade a student may recieve
		is the number of problems in the set.</li>
	<li><b>Deduct Retries:</b> For each problem in the set, the student recieves
		some fractional grade equal to the number of correct attempts he had
		divided by the number of total attempts. The sum of this value for each
		problem is his total grade. The maximum grade a student may recieve is the
		number of problems in the set.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have another grading method you wish to use, please describe it in
an email to <a href='mailto:pas@truman.edu'>the author of this module</a>. He
will gladly include it in future versions.</p>
