Introduction

wwassign is a set of software that enables the bridging of Moodle and 
WeBWorK 2.2.2 and higher.
The goal of this bridge is to allow a WeBWorK homework set to appear
as an assignment within Moodle.  The WeBWorK courses uses Moodle's list of users
to authenticate the user and to determine whether they are enrolled in the course.
Moodle  also queries the WeBWorK database to determine each student's score
for the problem set and places the score in Moodle's gradebook.  

As of this writing the instructor needs to set up the homeworkset in WeBWorK,
assign it to students with in WeBWorK, and then on the Moodle side add the assignment
to the list of assignments for that week.  There are links that make it easier
for the instructor to move back and forth between Moodle and WeBWorK easily.

(There are plans for automating some of this work, but they are not implemented in this version.)


Assumptions

Throughout this document I will make several assumptions:

  * WeBWorK is installed at /opt/webwork2.

  * Moodle is installed at /var/www/moodle.

You are, of course, free to use different locations, however you should be
careful to adapt the instructions herein to your setup.

Additionally, if you are using the MySQL database server, I assume that you are
using version 4.1 or newer.

Chapter 2. Installing WeBWorK

The documents for installation are at: http://devel.webwork.rochester.edu/twiki/bin/view/Webwork/InstallationManualV2pt2

Instructions for downloading WeBWorK from CVS are at:

http://devel.webwork.rochester.edu/twiki/bin/view/Webwork/WeBWorKCVSReadOnly

(This is recommended since it makes the update procedure very easy.)

The main page http://devel.webwork.rochester.edu/twiki/bin/view/Webwork/WebHome
has a link for the current release.  Moodle bridging works for WeBWorK 2.2.2 and higher.


 Chapter 3. Configuring Moodle:
 
 Within Moodle ensure that you have configured session data to be stored in
    the database.

     a. Log in to Moodle as an administrator and select the "Configuration"
        option.

     b. Scroll down to the "Operating System" section and find the "dbsession"
        option.

     c. Ensure it is set to "Yes".

At this point any course set to use "sql_moodle" as it's database schema will
get it's user list and access rights from the Moodle course with the same short
name (eg: CS435) as the WeBWorK course.


Chapter 4. Adding wwassignment to Moodle Modules

It is time to install the wwassignment Moodle
module. 

 1. From the wwmoodle directory copy the folder wwassignment to /var/www/
    moodle/mod/.

    cp -r wwassignment/ /var/www/moodle/mod/

 2. Move the file /var/www/moodle/mod/wwassignment/lang.php to /var/www/moodle/lang
    /en/wwassignment.php 
    
    or if you are using the new utf8 character set, copy to the folder 
    /var/www/moodle/lang/en_utf8/wwassignment.php

    mv /var/www/moodle/mod/wwassignment/lang.php /var/www/moodle/lang/en/wwassignment.php

 3. Move the folder /var/www/moodle/mod/wwassignment/help to /var/www/moodle/lang/
    en/help/wwassignment.

    mv /var/www/moodle/mod/wwassignment/help/ /var/www/moodle/lang/en/help/wwassignment

 4. Log in to Moodle as an administrative user and go to the "Admin..."
    section. The  new modules should be set up automatically.

 8. Go to Moodle's module configuration page and configure "WeBWorK Problem Set".

With that you are now ready to use WeBWorK from within your Moodle courses.

Do please note that at this time, there are no alternate language to English
for wwmoodle. However, if you would like to translate it, feel free to send me
your translations and I will include them in future releases. (gage@math.rochester.edu)


Chapter 5. Creating a WeBWorK course for use with Moodle


Create the companion course in WeBWorK using the "Course Administration" page.
(the url will be something like: http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/webwork2/admin )
You need to be a WeBWorK administrator (i.e. a member of the WeBWorK admin course) in
order to create a WeBWorK course.

When creating the WeBWorK course, its name must be the same as the "shortname" of 
the companion Moodle course.  In Moodle a course is given a shortname such as MTH165
and a longer one such as "Linear Algebra".  The WeBWorK companion course must be
created with the name MTH165 (the name is case sensitive).

When asked for the datbase layout choose "sql_moodle".  This is the only requirement
for making the course compatible with Moodle.  At this point WeBWorK will 
use Moodle to enumerate users and determine what
access rights they have. 

(You should make sure that you are 
a teacher of the Moodle MTH165 course or you may not be able to edit
the WeBWorK MTH165 course.)

The next step on the WeBWorK side is to login to the WeBWorK MTH165 course 
(there is a link from the  course administration page). Choose the 
Course Configuration link, and from the choices
presented choose the "moodle" template for the course.  While not essential, 
this adjuststhe WeBWorK HTML display so that it looks good inside the Moodle 
frame. (Thanks to Davide Cervone for developing this.)

Finally build a homework set in WeBWorK -- this can be done from the "Homework Sets Editor"
page in WeBWorK-- choose to import the "set0" or the "Orientation to WeBWorK" set which 
is present in most webowrk installations. Assign this homework set to all
currently enrolled students.


Chapter 6. Adding a webwork problem set to a course.
 1. Log in to Moodle as a teacher of the course which you wish to use with
    WeBWorK.


 2. Go to the home page for that course and "Turn editing on".

 3. In the weekly outline find the week where you'd like the homeworkset to appear
   and from the drop-down box entitled
    "Add an activity...". select "WebWorK Problem Set" from this box.

 4. Fill out the form presented to you.

      * You may have only one choice for the problem set (set0).  The pop-up
        menu shows which problem sets have been created within WeBWorK and are 
        available to be assigned.

      * To build more problem sets you can return to WeBWorK (there is a link).


 5. As your students complete the assigned set you will be able to view their
	grades from within Moodle with the normal "Grades" tool.
	
Chapter 7. Some cautions: non-features (or at least not-yet-features)

From the instructor's point of view the intergration of WeBWorK and Moodle is not yet
complete. Certain actions have to be done on the WeBWorK side and others on the Moodle
side -- a few have to be done on both.

1.	If new students are added to the Moodle course, homework sets will NOT be automatically
	created for these new students.  To create the problem sets for new users you 
	go to the WeBWorK course, Homework Sets Editor page 
	and in the homework sets row click on the column labeled "Edit Assigned Users".
	Clicking the "Assign to all Current Users" button will assign homework sets to the 
	new students without disturbing any of the homework sets already assigned.
	
	This process an be annoying if students are allowed to self-register, but it is manageable.
	
2.  The due dates for homework sets must be assigned in WeBWorK (the "Homework Sets Editor page), 
    however the listing in Moodle of "WeBWorK Problem Sets" will list all of the homework sets
    with correct, up-to-the-minute due dates since it gets its information from the WeBWorK database.
    
    If you change a homework set due date for one individual this will not be published in 
    Moodle, but will appear on the summary page of the WeBWorK homework set (in the 
    upper right hand information section.)
    
Many thanks to Peter Snoblin for creating wwmoodle upon which this Moodle module is based and to 
Sam Hathaway for adding the subclasses to WeBWorK that facilitate this intergration. Thanks to 
Davide Cervone for the moodle template.

Take care,
Mike Gage
