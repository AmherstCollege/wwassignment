<p align='center'><b>WeBWorK/Moodle Bridge</b></p>

<p>The WeBWorK/Moodle Bridge allows you to readily use WeBWorK from within
Moodle. Simply create problem sets within WeBWorK and assign them to your
students from here. Once they've completed the assignment, their grades
will be imported back into Moodle.</p>

<p>This bridge serves as a piece of background software, to ensure that
everything runs smoothly. If you want to use WeBWorK from within Moodle,
you'll have to add an instance of this module to your course.</p>
