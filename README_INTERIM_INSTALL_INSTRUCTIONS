This module is undergoing rapid change as of June 2006.  It starts with code written by Peter Snoblin at
Truman University.  It is being modified to work with WeBWorK release  2.2.1 and later.



6/27/2006
The two moodle modules wwmoodle and wwmoodleset have been replaced by one module called wwassignment.

For webwork make sure that you are updated to HEAD (cvs update -A -d ).  In particular make sure that there is a directory
lib/WeBWorK/DB/Schema/Moodle and that it contains files.  This current HEAD will soon be tagged as rel-2-2-1

Update global.conf and database.conf from the corresponding distribution files.  In particular database.conf should have 
a schema labeled sql_moodle.

The files in the WeBWorK subdirectory of this module are for historical purposes.  They have been superceeded by new files in
the HEAD (aka rel-2-2-1) version of WeBWorK.

Move  wwassigment  to    moodle/mod   in the moodle tree.  

If you transfer the CVS directories then you will still be able to update wwassignment
from the CVS in its new location.

Transfer
wwassigment/help         to         ...../moodle/lang/en/help/wwassigment
wwassigment/lang.php     to         ...../moodle/lang/en/wwassigment.php
 
These two files will need to be updated by hand everytime they change in the CVS.

If you are using the new utf8 encoding then transfer the files above to:

wwassigment/help         to         ...../moodle/lang/en_utf8/help/wwassigment
wwassigment/lang.php     to         ...../moodle/lang/en_utf8/wwassigment.php

From the Moodle directory of this module:
Move  wwmoodle and wwmoodleset   to    moodle/mod   in the moodle tree.  wwmoodle_set is for historical purposes only and will not
be used.
ATTENTION: this next section is not correct
Use symlinks to link wwmoodle/help  to the alias ...../moodle/lang/en/help/wwmoodle
                     wwmoodleset/help to         ...../moodle/lang/en/help/wwmoodleset
                     wwmoodle/lang.php           ...../moodle/lang/en/wwmoodle.php
                     wwmoodleset/lang.php        ...../moodle/lang/en/wwmoodleset.php

(the .....  refers to the nodes above where the moodle tree starts)
Moodle WILL NOT FOLLOW SYMLINKS. Hence you will need to actually copy the files to their new locations.
This also means that you will not be able to automatically update the wwmoodle.php and wwmoodleset.php files
in lang from the CVS.  The help files can still be updated.

If you transfer the CVS directories then you will still be able to update wwmoodle and wwmoodleset from the CVS in their new 
locations.
