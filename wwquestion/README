Webwork Question Type
----------------------
Version: 1.0 (stable RC1) Released 9/12/2007
Maintainer: Matthew Leventi  <mleventi@gmail.com>
CVS: cvs.webwork.rochester.edu:/webwork/cvs/system wwmoodle/wwquestion

This is a moodle questiontype module that will allow webwork questions to be asked in Moodle Quizzes and Lessons. Currently it supports many of the features found in the webwork2 system. Almost all WeBWorK questions should work with this system. (If you find one that doesnt send me a copy).

* If you are using this send me an email. Feedback is appreciated. *

Current Release:
* Show Partial Answer Questions Work!
* New Unit Tests to ensure proper setup.
* Code refactoring

Upgrading:
Backward Compatibility of existing questions is not guaranteeded. To upgrade your Database loading and unloading the webwork DB file in the XMLDB editor should make the necessary changes.


Setup:
1) Run the perl installation script in bin/setup/setup.pl
2) Point your browser to http://yourmoodle/admin to setup the question_webwork database table.

Testing:
1) In the site administration -> reports -> unit tests run the webwork unit tests. Enter '/question/type/webwork/simpletest' to only run the webwork tests. 

Use:
Go into the question bank and create a new WeBWorK question. Besides the usual question options there are a few WeBWorL specific fields.
Code       -> Copy and paste the PG code into this field.
Files      -> Upload any necessary external files that the question depends on.
Code Check -> This determines how strict the checker should be in determining whether your question works
Seed       -> The starting seed on which to create question derivations.
Trials     -> The number of derivations to create. (Roughly)

Note on Question Creation:
As you increase trials question creation will take longer. If you need a lot of external files question creation will also take longer. Longest time I have seen is about a minute. The reason for the delay involves the creation of derived questions based on the PG code. It means that viewing of questions should be very fast. Student answer checks will also be faster.

Note on Randomness:
WeBWorK Questions are not truly random within this module. The trials option determines the size of a pool of questions that are generated from the PG code. Students will get a random derivation out of the pool as the question they have to answer. When an instructor previews a question in the bank he/she will see a random seed.

Finding webwork questions:

An example can be found in simpletest/sampleProblem.pg as well.
