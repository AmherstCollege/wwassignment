<h1>File Handler</h1>

<p>This allows you to upload any files that the PG code requires as external dependencies. Examples would be images, java applet code, etc. Please only upload necessary files. The more you upload the slower question creation will be. Although the number of files will not effect the speed a question is displayed.</p>

<p>The derivations directory holds information about the current question derivations.</p>
