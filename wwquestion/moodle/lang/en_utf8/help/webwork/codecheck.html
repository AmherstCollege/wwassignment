<h1>Code Checking</h1>

<p>This field determines how strictly Moodle will check your PG code. If a question fails to clear code checking the question edit form will be displayed with the errors and warnings the question produced. There are five levels of code checking:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Turn Off (unadvised)</b><br>
        This will turn of Code Checking completely. It is strongly recommended that you do not use this setting.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Reject Problem Seeds w/ Errors (silent)</b><br>
        This setting will reject any seeds that are generated with errors. Warnings are ignored. If any error-free seeds are found within the alloted trials they will be used as derivations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Reject Question if any Errors exist (strict)</b><br>
        This setting will reject the question if any errors are found on any seeds. Warnings are ignored. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Problem Seeds w/ Errors or Warnings (silent)</b><br>
